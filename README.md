A high-performance distributed web crawler designed to efficiently crawl and index web pages across multiple machines. This system leverages parallel processing for large-scale data collection with improved throughput and reliability.
Features

Distributed Architecture: Seamlessly distributes crawling tasks across multiple machines
Fault Tolerance: Continues operation even if individual nodes fail
Scalability: Easily scale horizontally by adding more worker nodes
Configurable Crawl Policies: Fine-tuned control over crawl depth, URL patterns, and rate limiting
Data Processing Pipeline: Extract, transform, and store web data efficiently
Monitoring Dashboard: Real-time metrics and crawl progress visualization

System Architecture
The system is built with a master-worker architecture:

Master Node: Manages the crawl frontier, assigns tasks, and monitors worker status
Worker Nodes: Execute crawling tasks and process web content
Task Queue: Distributes work efficiently between nodes using Celery/RabbitMQ
Storage Layer: Flexible storage options including distributed file systems and databases
